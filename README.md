# Leaderboard

## NOTE: This is still a Work In Progress project!

### Introduction
This project is a simple application for me to get experience in creating Full Stack Applications. It is a simple leaderboard website which would have an admin website to control the scores and a public website to view the leaderboard. The admin website will have analytics to view trends and how progress is going. I am still getting ideas on how to continue this project, so you will definitely find things changing frequently.

I will update this README file as I progress with the project. By the end of the project, this will be filled with Installation methods, in depth explanation, FAQs, etc...
